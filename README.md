# [Project_1: Netflix Content Analysis](NetflixDashboard.pbix)

This project is my first data analysis portfolio, focusing on exploring and analyzing Netflix content data.
I used this project to practice my skills as a Data Analyst, starting from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and ending with data visualization through Power BI dashboards.
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including title, country, genre, release year, and content type.
